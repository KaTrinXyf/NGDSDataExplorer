<b>NGDS Data Portal & Map Viewer</b><br><br>
This program searches catalogs for features based on a keyword and/or defined map extent. It then displays the features on a map, allows for the selection of features, and can create a table of selected features.<br><br>

This program contains the following parts:<br>
1. The Catalog Search<br>
2. The Data Service Toolbar<br>
3. The Layer Tree<br>
4. The Map Panel Toolbar<br>
5. The Map Panel<br>
6. The Legend<br><br>

<b>1. The Catalog Search</b><br>
The Catalog Search allows for the search of the USGIN AASG Geothermal Data Catalog for features which can be mapped and queried. Select the catalog and type of search to be performed from the drop-down menus. Check or uncheck the box depending on whether or not the search should only look for data services containing features within the current map extent. Mouseover an item in the resulting list to see a pop-up with more information about the data service. To add the layer(s) from that data service, double-click the data service or click on the data service and then click the Add Layer button below the list.
<br><br>

<b>2. The Data Service Toolbar</b><br>
The Data Service Toolbar allows for the selection of data services to retrieve. There are two options for specifying the location of a desired data service.<br>
1. The Quick-Pick Data Service Drop-down Menu - Select a data service from the drop-down menu and its layers will be added to the layer tree.<br>
2. Base Url Input - Click the button to the right of the data service drop-down menu. Input a base url as in the example. Press enter. Layers will be added to the tree.<br><br>

<b>3. The Layer Tree</b><br>
The Layer Tree lists the layers that available to be show in the map. Check the box next to the layer name to retrieve the layer and make it visible. Uncheck the box to hide the layer. Drag and drop the layer names to change the order of the layers. Click on the name of a layer to highlight the layer in blue and set that layer as the active layer. The Layer Tree panel can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the arrows. Remove a layer by selecting a layer to make it the active layer and then clicking the Remove Layer button at the bottom of the layer tree panel. Also at the bottom is a status bar which indicates if a layer is currently loading. <br><br>
