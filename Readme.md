NGDS Data Explorer

The National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) Data Explorer was developed to be a lightweight, open-source, publicly-accessible web mapping application which facilitates the discovery of geothermal features without the need to switch between multiple interfaces. An integrated searchof the U.S. Geoscience Information Network (USGIN) Association of American State Geologists (AASG) Geothermal Data Catalog will list relevantfeature services available for attribute querying and display on a map. The search can be limited to a specific geographical extent for further refinement. Once added to the map, attributes for features can either be shown in a feature popup or a table. Users can also select features from different data services for display in a single table. The NGDS Data Explorer is primarily for geologists and other researchers needing a quick and easy way to retrieve information about U.S. geothermal features without the need for software beyond a web browser or the knowledge of who hosts which services.
